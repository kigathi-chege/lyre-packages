- Button - Basic button with title and link

- Text - For managing all text within your sections
- Data - Some sections require data from your application, data is defined here in a json, see the example below

## Installation

```bash
composer require lyre/content
```

### Publish Assets

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lyre\Content\Providers\LyreContentServiceProvider"
```

### Dependencies

Lyre Content depends on [Lyre](https://packagist.org/packages/lyre/lyre) and [Laravel Filament](https://filamentphp.com/). To complete installation, especially if your require the functionalities from Laravel Filament, follow these additional commands:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --panels
```

To create an admin user:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

#### Discover Content Filament Resources

To Discover Lyre Content Filament Resources on your Filament dashboard, add the LyreContentFilamentPlugin to your Filament panel like so:

```php
use Lyre\Content\Filament\Plugins\LyreContentFilamentPlugin;

$panel->plugins([
    new LyreContentFilamentPlugin(),
]);
```

# ISSUES

You need to change your minimum-stability level to `dev` on your composer.json like:

```json
"minimum-stability": "dev",
```

This is because Lyre Content depends on a fork of [FilamentShield](https://github.com/bezhanSalleh/filament-shield/pull/537) that has not yet been merged to [main](https://github.com/bezhanSalleh/filament-shield).

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class="Lyre\\Content\\Database\\Seeders\\InteractionTypeSeeder"
```
